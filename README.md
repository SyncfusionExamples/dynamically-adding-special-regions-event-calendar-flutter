# How to add a special region dynamically using onTap, onViewChanged callbacks of the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to add a special region dynamically using onTap, onViewChanged callbacks of the Flutter Calendar.

You can add special regions to the Flutter Event Calendar by using the [onViewChanged](), [onTap](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/callbacks#calendar-tap-callback), and [onPressed](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/callbacks#long-press-callback) callbacks.

In this sample, the special regions are added to the tapped or long pressed time slots by using the Flutter calendar's 'onViewChanged,' 'onTap,' and 'onpressed' callbacks.
